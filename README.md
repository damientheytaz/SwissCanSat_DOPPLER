# SwissCanSat_DOPPLER

SwissCanSat competition, oragnized by the European Space Agency (ESA), brought to Switzerland thanks to the HES-SO. 

The SwissCanSat competition is an educational initiative that brings together teams of high school students to design, build and launch their own
miniature satellite. The satellite must be the size and shape of a soft drink can (CanSat). After launching a balloon from an altitude one kilometer, 
the CanSat must perform a primary mission, which consists of measuring the évolution of pression, humidity and temperature during the flight, as well 
as a secondary mission up to the team's choice. 

As a secondary mission, we choose to take multiple measurements related to the air quality. Including but not restricted to: microparticules, fine 
particles, heavy metals concentrations. 

We are a group of five classmates and great friends from the Lycée-Collège des Creusets (Sion,Switzerland). Team DOPPLER consists of :  
Damien Theytaz          -       Main programmer, spokesperson for outreach  
Fabian Da Cuna          -       Auxiliary programmer  
Esteban Rodrigues       -       Welding, 3D modeling, parachute design  
Jérémy Perruchoud       -       Mechanical design, 3D modeling, head of outreach  
Jérémy Narayanasamy     -       Welding, paperwork officer  
(PS: Many thanks to Fabien from the HES-Sion for his crucial help and his involvement in the project.)

This repository indexes all the files relevant to our participation in the competition. The code is broken down into two main folders :
1. Ground_Station : Code related to the radio station which we will use to recover the data sent from the CanSat.
2. Onboard_CanSat : Code related to the mini-satellite per say, it commands the components embedded in the CanSat.
