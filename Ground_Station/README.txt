The ground station's role is to receive the data mesured by the CanSat, then proceed to its storage. 

The ground station consists of three main elements. 
First of all, the Raspberry Pi Pico serves as a mini-computer that control and communicate with the two other components.
Secondly, Adafruit's RFM9X LoRa Radio recieves the data from the onboard radio.
Thirdly, the mentioned data will be stored thanks to Adafruit's MicroSD card breakout board.
